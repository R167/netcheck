// Package routes provides network routing table analysis functionality for netcheck.
//
// This checker examines the local system's routing table to understand network
// configuration and path selection. It displays both IPv4 and IPv6 routes,
// helping users understand how traffic is directed through their network.
//
// The routes checker is a standalone checker that does not require router access
// and provides information about the local system's network configuration.
